Toronto COVID-19 data was pulled from the City of Toronto Open Portal to analyze the effects of the pandemic on various age groups and find which age groups are most vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus. We noted that although the older populations have a lower number of cases, they have a higher number of deaths, which leads to a higher mortality rate. This information has been used by scientists and policy makers to outline public health guidelines for the city of Toronto.

This repository has an RMD file that extracts the input datasets from Open Data Toronto using the opendatatoronto R Package. It is used to analyze the effects of COVID 19 on various age groups using dplyr and janitor R Packages. The plots are created using ggplot2, knitr, kableExtra, grid, and gridExtra. Install the above listed R Packages before executing the RMD file.
